				<h2>Report sharing System</h2>
				<p>
					I developed this project during my coop training, it's a desktop
					application that allow to record information about the jobs done in
					the maintenance department. information include job description,
					employee, and machine details. it helps with organized tracking of all
					maintenance activities, making things easier to manage, it also shows
					how long machines were down, which is useful for spotting patterns or
					figuring out which machines need more attention.

				<p>
					The application provides a form-based interface that allows users to
					record maintenance jobs directly into the SQL Server database. Users
					can add, update, or delete job records using the Job ID. Any changes
					made to the database are immediately reflected in the data table
					displayed within the application.
